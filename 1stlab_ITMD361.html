		Hello! My name is Kelly Perez 
	</p>
	<p>

		I have an associates degree in computer science, and now I am going for my ITM bachelors. I work as a dietary aid and when I graduate I want to work as a security analyst. In my free time I like two run, I have ran 2 marathons, a couple of half marathons and many 5k's/10k's, and now I am training for my third marathon but not sure if I will actually do it due to a knee and ankle injury.
